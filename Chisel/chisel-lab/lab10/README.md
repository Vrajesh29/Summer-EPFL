# Lab 10: Testing the Vending Machine (Optional)

In this lab you will write tests for a vending machine.
You are given two implementations of a vending machine as
black boxes. One is correctly implementing the specification,
one contains an error. Find out with your tests which one is
correct and what is the error in the other implementation.

Note, that for this test you need to have Verilator installed:
https://www.veripool.org/verilator/

And Verilator needs a C compiler installed.

**Due to the requirement of Verilator installation, this lab is
optional. However, it is nevertheless good to work on a test for
you vending machine early on.**
